1. I have to remove the attributes method="" and action="" from the form element in order to prevent the browser 
from sending data to the server and leading to a page reload. From the reference book I read, it should not be an 
issue as long as I include a return false at the end of submitAndClear(). Also the page is not reloaded when I test
the codes in my local server, but it is not the case after it is uploaded. Is there something I am missing?

2. I have a problem of using onblur to validate each input field of the form and set the focus back if invalidated. 
In EE, as you pointed out in the discussion forum, if there are more than one input elements with onblur having such 
validate() handlers, the two elements will fire its onblur handlers as the focus is relocating between them, resulting 
in an *infinite* back&forth alert() messaging which could hang IE. I got this issue a few times when I test my codes in 
EE. I also tried to use onchange to validate each field. However, the event does not always fire. Instead I am using the
background color to highlight the input field if it is not validated, as you suggested in the discussion forum. If the
field is validated, the background color will change back to the default value.

3. I added two interactivities to the page using the cross-browser event handlers and the cross-browser objects to the page. One is 
use the mouseover event to check the coordinates and another is use the HTML load event handler to load the image to the page.
