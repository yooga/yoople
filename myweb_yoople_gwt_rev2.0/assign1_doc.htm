<p>1. I am using Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers to write and debug JavaScript. It works, but it does not support some of key features I really need such as Syntax Highlighting 
, Full outlining showing Classes, Functions and Fields Highlight, and check of matching bracket / parenthesis, etc. Sometimes I have hard time debugging the codes. I need to add 
the plugin of JSDT into my current IDE or install the Eclipse IDE for JavaScript Developers. Either way should make my life a little easier.</p><br>

2. I used the string pattern-match method to replace space and newline so that the triangle can be displayed properly in the HTML content.

First, I tried the following codes. It did not work and the browser had a silent return. 

var charTriangle_string = output.replace(/ /g, "&nbsp");
charTriangle_string=charTriangle_string.replace(/\n/g,"<br>");
return charTriangle_string;
     
Then I modified the codes as follows. It works and the triangle is properly displayed in the HTML context.
     
var charTriangle_string = output.replace(/ /g, "&nbsp").replace(/\n/g,"<br>");
return charTriangle_string;

It seems to me that both should work, but in reality the first one did not. Has somebody figured out why?
