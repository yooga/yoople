1.For Part I I first tried creating one XHR object and reusing it to call both twitter and google servers
one by one to extract and display the content on my page at the same time. It works well in EE, but it does
not in FF. In FF, only the results of the last call was displayed on my page. I get around this issue by creating
two XHR object, one is used to extract the response from the googel and another is used to extract the results from
the Twitter. It works well in both IE and FF.

2. For Part II, I improved my Student reference type constructor by making it scope-safe. I also used the lazy-loading 
technique and optimized the createXHR() function.
