<p>1. I installed the Eclipse IDE for Javascript Developers into my laptop. It works and supports some of key features I need such as Syntax Highlighting 
, Full outlining showing Classes, Functions and Fields Highlight, and check of matching bracket / parenthesis, etc. However, I still like to use my current IDE for
Java EE Developers because I can include all the files into a standalone dynamic project to debug, run and then deploy to my local application server such as Tomcat, 
before I upload them to the web servet at Foothill College. It saves me lots of time. My current IDE has ECMAScript Build-In Libarary and ECMA 3 Browser Support Library,
but it did have the JS plugin installed. If I have time, I will learn more about the Eclipse IDE for Javascript Developer. </p><br>

2. You mentioned that we need to add a new function for student prototype in student.js- toHTML() that converts student data to HTML formatted string. I think we can also 
use the following codes w/o further modifications of the Student.js file: 

outputToElement('student_area',student.toString().replace(/\n/g,"<br>"))

I tested and got the same output as that of

outputToElement('student_area', student.toHTML());
